Pay Day is an addon for WoW The Burning Crusade 2.4.3. It is based on the
description of [Cross Gambling](https://atamis.me/crossgambling/).

PayDay is maintained at https://github.com/fallrisk/PayDay.

The code for Pay Day is mostly just WoW addon related. For the Cross Gambling
implementation refer to the library Meowth located in the libs directory.
